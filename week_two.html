		<h2>
			COMPASSION FOR YOUR SUBSTANCE ABUSE
		</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		<p>
			<b>Substance abuse can be understood as a misguided attempt to cope with PTSD and other problems.</b>
			Using substances may have been a way to numb the pain . .. get to sleep . .. escape negative feelings . .. forget about the past . . . get through the day . .. access feelings or memories that you know are there . .. try to feel normal . .. show people how bad you feel because you can't put it into words . .. compensate for your suffering ... give you some pleasure in life .... feel in control ... feel accepted by people . . . get rid of dissociation and flashbacks.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Viewing your substance abuse with compassion does not mean "it's okay to use,</b> or "If I use, I can excuse myself because I was trying to numb the pain." A major goal of this treatment is to eliminate all substance use.
			If you truly view your substance abuse with compassion, you will strive to eliminate it completely because you will see that, in the long run, it brings you only misery and dysfunction. Although it may sometimes work in the short run to
			"self-medicate" problems, it never works in the long run.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Examples of Viewing Substance Abuse with Compassion</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Can't stop using substances</b> <br>
			Harsh view. "I'm such a failure. Look what I turned into-I have no self-control; what a wreck."
			Compassionate view. "My substance abuse has been a way to try to deal with my overwhelming PTSD symp-toms. I've been trying to numb the pain. I now need to learn other ways to cope. Substance abuse is a medical ill-ness, and I need help with it "
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Lying about substance use </b> <br>
			Harsh view: "I'm a no-good liar. I lie to my partner, my kids, my doctor. I hate my life."
			Compassionate view: "I need to stop lying so I can recover. But there are real reasons why I lie about my sub-
			stance abuse: shame, guilt, feeling bad about myself. I need help working on these."
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>* Write a harsh versus compassionate view of your substance abuse.</em>
		</p>
		<p>Harsh view:____________</p>
		<p>Compassionate view:____________</p>
		<h3>
			STRENGTHS FROM ADVERSITY
		</h3>
		<p>
			Another way to view PTSD and substance abuse with compassion is to recognize the strengths you may have developed-the "gifts from suffering." Usually, the most profound growth occurs from overcoming difficult experiences.
			PTSD and substance abuse may have given you the ability to survive under tough conditions . .. imagination and cre ativity . . . depth . . . spirituality .
			sensitivity to others . . . awareness of the extremes in life . . . the ability to persist
			despite pain and setbacks . .. appreciation for animals, children, and people outside the mainstream ... responsiveness to art and nature.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>* Do you notice any personal strengths from your struggles with PTSD and substance abuse?</em>
		</p>

		<h2>
			Long-Term PTSD Problems
		</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		<p>
			This handout is provided for people who are already knowledgeable about PTSD and want additional information about its long-term impact. It can be upsetting to read, so ask your therapist first, and do not read this if you feel too vulnerable right now-you can wait until later in treatment. If you begin to read it and become upset, just stop.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the standard definition of PTSD described in Handout 1, there are other problems that may occur with PTSD, especially for people who have suffered repeated childhood abuse (Herman, 1992). You may have some and
			not others.

		<h3>
			Ideas for a Commitment
		</h3>
		<hr class="fade">
		<p>
			<em>
				Commit to one action that will move your life forward!
				It can be anything you feel will help you, or you can try one of the ideas below.
				Keeping your commitment is a way of respecting, honoring, and caring for yourself.
			</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			+ Option 1: Pretend that a TV station wants to interview you for a documentary, "People Who Survived PTSD and Substance Abuse," to help inspire others. The interviewer says,
			"Tell me what strengths have helped you
			to survive." What would you say?
		</p>
		<p>
			+ Option 2: How can you "take back your power"? Identify at least one PTSD or substance abuse problem you have and how you want to conquer it.
		</p>
		<p>
			+ Option 3: Bring to the next session something that symbolizes hope to you (perhaps a photograph of some one important to you, a picture of a place you want to visit, or a poem).
		</p>
		<p>
			+ Option 4: Reread the handouts from today's session and underline the material that makes you feel most
			motivated to work on your recovery.
		</p>
		<p>
			+ Option 5: Write a dialogue in which you talk to yourself compassionately about your PTSD and/or substance
			abuse problems.

		<h3>Chapters of My Life</h3>
<h4>Chapter 1:</h4>
<p>
I walked down the sidewalk and fell into a deep hole.
I couldn't get out and I couldn't figure out why. It wasn't my fault. It took a long time to get out.
</p>
<h4>Chapter 2:</h4>
<p>
I walked down the sidewalk and fell into the same hole again. I couldn't understand. It wasn't my fault. I really had to struggle to get out.
</p>
<h4>
Chapter 3:
</h4>
<p>
I walked down the sidewalk and fell into the same hole again. This time I understood why and it was my fault. This time it was easier to get out.
</p>
<h4>
Chapter 4:
</h4>
<p>
I walked down the sidewalk and saw the same big hole. I walked around it. I didn't fall into that hole.
</p>
<h4>
Chapter 5:
</h4>
<p>
I chose another sidewalk.

HANDOUT 3
Key Points about Red and Green Flags
* Red flags are messages of distress. Just as a fever is a sign that you must rest your body, the red flags are signs that you are in emotional distress. With PTSD and substance abuse, the tendency is to push them out of mind, unconscious, not seeing the signs as they occur. But it is essential to notice the red flags and to validate that they are there for a reason; they are not signs of weakness or failure, but messages to attend to yourself.
Remember "budding." Some people are helped by the acronym "BUD"-"Building Up to Drinking." You could also use "Building Up to Danger." The list of red flags in Handouts 1 and 2 can be a sign that you are gearing up to act destructively. There is a window of opportunity during which you can stop yourself from sliding downhill if you can see the warning signs and actively try to cope with them. Thus dangerous times in both PTSD and substance abuse are not all-or-none events, but rather gradual buildups that allow time to save yourself.
• Help from others is essential as danger escalates. As red flags increase, the need to reach out for help from safe people increases too. One of the most difficult aspects of PTSD and substance abuse is isolation. As symptoms increase,
the tendency is to hide away. That's why it is necessary to plan in advance whom you will call and to
prepare that person for how to help you through a dangerous time. Rehearse what you will say to each other.
* Listen to the "whispers" before they become "screams." A safety plan identifies your warning signs and ways to respond to them. The safety plan in Handout 2 has three levels so that you can attend to mild danger signs (level 1) before they become an emergency (level 3). The earlier in the process you take action, the better.
• As danger increases, so does acting out rather than talking. Notice that many of the danger signs are behaviors. As distress increases, it is essential to keep talking about your feelings; otherwise you'll likely find yourself
"acting them out" in your behavior. Think of a small child who feels hurt and starts punching a wall. When the child cannot express the feelings directly, they get acted out.
* Most substance abuse relapses occur within 90 days of abstinence. Research shows the first 90 days to be a vulnerable time, across various substances of abuse (heroin, smoking, alcohol). Thus knowing your danger signs is especially important in early recovery.
• Notice spiraling. In recovery, there is a process of "spiraling" or "snowballing" that can occur in both positive and negative directions. A downward spiral occurs when symptoms start to pick up speed and get worse and worse, often rapidly. An upward spiral occurs when your recovery efforts are so persistent that good things begin to happen. For example, you get a job, and are therefore able to get an apartment in a safer area, where you can make friends with healthier people, and so on ...
Acknowledgments: The concept of relapse warning signs is described in detail in Marlatt and Gordon (1985). The term "red flag" is from Trotter
(1992). The safety plan (Handout 2) is derived from a form used in the McLean Hospital Women's Day Treatment Program, author unknown. Ask your therapist for guidance if you would like to locate any of these sources.

Ideas for a Commitment
Commit to one action that will move your life forward!
It can be anything you feel will help you, or you can try one of the ideas below.
Keeping your commitment is a way of respecting, honoring, and caring for yourself.
+ Option 1: Give a copy of your safety plan to people you trust (e.g., safe family, friends, therapist, sponsor) and ask them for comments.
+ Option 2: Write a personal story of bravery: "How I Faced a Red Flag and Won."
+ Option 3: Write a "How To Help Me"
guide that you can give to people in your life. Describe your danger
signs and what people can do to help when they see you slipping.
+ Option 4: Write out what you can say to yourself when you're in (a) mild danger and (b) serious danger.
+ Option 5: Fill out the Safe Coping Sheet. (See below for an example applied to this topic.

* Your Coping *
Pissed off, tailgated him for the next 3 miles. Feel like I can't take the stress. I keep thinking about using.
I need to see the danger signs earlier. As soon as I feel this stressed, it means using comes next. I need a buffer from the world-I'm going to go to a meeting, and just take a "mental health" day off from work.
Consequence
Nothing is getting better;
I'm slipping.
I was okay and felt more in control.

      <h2>Cognitive Triad</h2>
      <p>
        Mindfulness skills are very important skills because they get us present in the moment. We can begin to label and notice our feelings and thoughts. However, the question arises, what to do next? This next section explore the relationship between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and how if we are able to change one of these, then we are often able to improve our mood and/or make better choices for ourselves.
      </p>
      <P>
        The cognitive triad is a powerful model for explaining the relationship between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

<h3><b>Exploring Thoughts/Feelings/Behaviors</b></h3>
<p>
  Most of us go about our business without much attention to why we are doing things.
  Mindfulness allows us to slow down and explore in depth the relationship between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. When we do this, we begin to see the interrelationship between these three things.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, most depressed people have the following thoughts, "Life is hopeless. Why bother to do anything. It's no use." This leads to a feeling of heaviness and sadness, which leads to inaction and withdrawal from others. This behavior leads to more thoughts of hopelessness and futility, which leads to more depressed mood, which leads to more inaction, etc. Each part of the circle reinforces the others.
</p>
<p>
  A typical pattern of thoughts/feelings and behaviors can be constructed for most common emotions..

<h2>Checklist of Cognitive Distortions</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>All-or-nothing thinking:</b> You look at things in absolute, black-and-white categories.</li>
  <li> <b>Over generalization:</b> You view a negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.</li>
  <li><b>Mental filter:</b> You dwell on the negatives.</li>
  <li> <b>Discounting the positives:</b> You insist that your accomplishments or positive qualities don't count.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Jumping to conclusions: </b>(A)<b> Mind-reading</b>--you assume that people are reacting negatively to you when there's no definite evidence;
    (B) <b>Fortune-telling</b>--you arbitrarily predict that things will furn out badly.
  </li>
  <li><b>Magnification or minimization: </b>You blow things way out of proportion or you shrink their importance.</li>
  <li><b>Emotional reasoning:</b> You reason from how you feel: " feel like an idiot, so I really must be one.</li>
  <li>
    <b>"Should statements": </b>You criticize yourself (or other people) with "shoulds," "oughts," "musts" and "have tos."
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Labeling:</b> Instead of saying "I made a mistake," you tell yourself, "I'm a jerk," or "a fool." or "a loser."  
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Personalization and blame: </b>You blame yourself for something you weren't entirely responsible for, or you blame other people and deny your role in the problem.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Ideas for a Commitment</h2>
<hr class="fade">
<p>
  Commit to one action that will move your life forward!
  It can be anything you feel will help you, or you can try one of the ideas below.
  Keeping your commitment is a way of respecting, honoring, and caring for yourself.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Option 1: Take one harmful meaning from the handout and write out in detail how you can respond to it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Option 2: Describe and name a meaning that you have observed in yourself or others that is not already on the handout.  
  </li>
  <li>
    Option 3: Identify one major meaning that gives your life purpose (e.g., your children? your job? your spiritu-ality? your recovery?). Write out how that meaning can help keep you focused on your recovery.  
  </li>
  <li>
    Option 4: Write out how you can talk to yourself the next time you feel like doing something that is unsafe.  
  </li>
  <li>
    Option 5: Fill out the Safe Coping Sheet. (See below for an example applied to this topic.)
  </li>
</ul>

    <td><b>Your Coping</b></td>
    <td>Thought to myself, "I'm being abandoned; no one really cares about me." Drank half a bottle of wine.</td>
    <td>
      I'm using "Deprivation Reasoning"-thinking I have a right to drink because of suffering. Also, I'm using
      "All-or-None 'Thinking". In fact, there are people who care about me, and my therapist going away doesn't mean she doesn't care about me.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Consequence</b></td>
    <td>
      Drinking didn't get my therapist back from vacation- it made me feel better for a few hours, then worse for a
      few days.
    </td>
    <td> 
      By noticing the meanings I'm creating, I feel a little  more in touch with myself. 
      I'm going to talk to my therapist about how I feel.

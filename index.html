SEEKING SAFETY GROUP
</h2>
<hr class="fade">
<p>
Welcome to the Seeking Safety group. You were referred to this group by your mental health provider because you may have experienced, or are currently experiencing, trauma, which may include having the symptoms of PTSD (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder). The focus of the Seeking Safety group is to help participants <b> learn and implement skills in their everyday</b> lives that will help them cope with situations in which their trauma history causes them to be "triggered" in a way that is more intense than what one would typically expect in that situation.
</p>
<p>
This Seeking Safety group will consist of.10 weeks covering several topics. Participants will be asked to commit to attend all sessions if possible. If a participant misses two sessions, they will be asked to restart the group at a later time when greater attendance is possible.
</p>
<p>
The focus of the Seeking Safety group is to help support people in developing coping skills that can keep them safe from harm, such as dangerous behaviors or dangerous relationships. The Seeking Safety group is focused on learning coping skills to deal with present life situations. Participants will not be asked to describe the details of their trauma, though references to their trauma may be made on a
"headlines only" basis. This is a very important group rule, as we do not want to trigger other members with trauma details of any sort.
</p>
<p>
Each Seeking Safety Session consists of four parts:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Check-in (up to 5 minutes per person): How have you coped in the past week? Any unsafe behaviors? At least one example of good coping. Did you follow through on your commitment from last session and on resources for help?
	</li>
	<li>
		The Quotation: A brief discussion about a meaningful quote.	
	</li>
	<li>
		Topic of the Week: review of the week's handout and discussion of how it relates to each person's life.	
	</li>
	<li>
		Check-Out: Name on thing you got out of today's session. What is your new commitment? What community resources will you call?	
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
Participants will be asked to review the appropriate handouts in preparation for discussion the following week. The handouts correlate with the topics listed on the page following, Session Topics.
</p>
<p>
We anticipate that your participation in the Seeking Safety group will help you find and develop an array of skills that will help you cope with the challenges that occur in your everyday life.
</p>
<P>
	Please contact <hr> at <hr>
	if you need to cancel a group meeting or have any concerns that arise in the course of a group session.

		<h2>
			About the Seeking Safety Treatment
		</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		<h3>
			WHAT IS THE SEEKING SAFETY TREATMENT?
		</h3>
		<p>
			This treatment is designed for people with substance abuse and trauma. "Trauma" means that a person has suffered a severe life event, such as physical or sexual abuse, a car accident, or a hurricane. Many men and most women who abuse substances have experienced a trauma during their lifetime. Some people develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of their trauma; you will learn more about this during treatment.
		</p>
		<p>
			The treatment consists of 25 psychotherapy topics. It is an "integrated" treatment, meaning that both trauma and substance abuse issues are worked on at the same time to promote the most successful recovery possible. It was developed at Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital beginning in 1993, with funding by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
		</p>
		<h3>
			WHY IS IT CALLED SEEKING SAFETY?
		</h3>
		<p>
			The #1 goal of the treatment is to help you become safe. "Safety" includes the ability to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Manage trauma symptoms (such as flashbacks, nightmares, and negative feelings).</li>
			<li>
				Cope with life without the use of substances.		
			</li>
			<li>
				Take good care of yourself (such as getting regular medical exams and eating well).		
			</li>
			<li>
				Find safe people who can be supportive to you.	
			</li>
			<li>
				Free yourself from domestic violence or other current abusive relationships.		
			</li>
			<li>
				Prevent self-destructive acts (such as cutting, suicidal impulses, and unsafe sex).		
			</li>
			<li>
				Find ways to feel good about yourself and to enjoy life.		
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>You may want to start thinking about what safety means to you.</em></p>
		<h4>
			FINDING SELF-RESPECT
		</h4>
		<p>
			Many people who have PTSD and substance abuse-especially if these have gone on for a long time-find it hard to like themselves. You may feel that you have never really gotten to know yourself, or that you have lost yourself somewhere along the way. This treatment seeks to help you understand yourself, to develop a new identity as someone who can cope successfully with life, and to respect who you are.
		</p>
		<h4>
			WHAT WILL BE COVERED IN THE TREATMENT?
		</h4>
		<p>
			Each topic will focus on a specific strategy to help you cope with trauma and substance abuse. Examples of topics are Honesty; Asking for Help; Setting Boundaries in Relationships; Taking Good Care of Yourself; Compassion; Recovery Thinking; Creating Meaning; Self-Nurturing; Respecting Your Time; Getting Others to Support Your Recovery; and Community Resources:
		</p>
		<p>
			The treatment is evenly divided among behavioral, cognitive, and interpersonal topics. "Behavioral" refers to your actions; "cognitive" refers to your thinking; and "interpersonal" refers to your relationships. Because of the focus on thinking and actions, the treatment is called "cognitive-behavioral." This type of psychotherapy was originally developed by Dr. Aaron Beck at the University of Pennsylvania. Previous research has shown that cognitive-behavioral treatments can be helpful for a variety of psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.
		</p>

		<h4>
			WHAT IS THE FORMAT OF THE SESSIONS?
		</h4>
		<p>
			Each treatment session is structured to make the most of the time available.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Check-in. At the start of each session, you will be asked five questions: "How are you feeling?", "What good coping have you done?"
				"Any substance use or other unsafe behavior?",
				"Did you complete your commitment?"
				and "Community resource update?" (Some of these terms may be unfamiliar to you, but they will become clear.)
			</li>
			<li>
				Handout. You will be given a written sheet that summarizes the main points of the topic.
			</li>
			<li>
				Discussion/practice. Most of the session will be spent discussing the session topic. For example, we will discuss how the topic relates to your life, and ways in which to apply the concept to current problems you have. Also, several topics have exercises in which you will have the opportunity to practice a new strategy, such as role plays, or an in-session practice exercise. Your participation will always be voluntary, so you can just watch if you prefer that.
			</li>
			<li>
				Check-out. At the end of the session, you will be asked to describe your views of the session. Also, you will be asked to name one action you can commit to before the next session. This is to help you move forward in your life as quickly as possible. It will always be up to you to decide what you want to commit to, but the therapist can help you think of options. Examples might include trying to ask someone in your life for help; calling up a hotline if you feel in distress; writing about your feelings; getting an HIV test; or doing something fun every day for a week.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>
			WHAT IF I MISS A SESSION?
		</h4>
		<p>
			If you miss a session, you can call to have the session material mailed to you. Or you can pick it up at the next session (or in advance if you know you'll be away). The goal is to help you get the most from this treatment! Please try, how-ever, to be here for every session.
		</p>
		<h4>
			WILL I BE TERMINATED FROM TREATMENT FOR USING A SUBSTANCE?
		</h4>
		<p>
			No. The goal is to help you attain abstinence; however, the approach is to try to help you learn from mistakes and understand better what motivates the choices you make. You will not be terminated from treatment for using sub-stances. You would only be prevented from returning to treatment if you present a serious danger to staff or patients (e.g., assault, selling drugs).
		</p>
		<h4>
			WILL I GET A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT MY TRAUMA?
		</h4>
		<p>
			Yes, but the aim will be to talk about the impact of your trauma on your current life. Sometimes people want to talk a lot about the past, but then are unable to manage overwhelming feelings and memories that come up. Our goal is to help you establish safety first and to learn strategies to cope with intense negative feelings. Once you have mastered these, you can-and should-move on to talking in depth about the past. These guidelines are particularly true if you are in a group treatment, because details about past traumas (and, similarly, "war stories" about substance use) can be too upsetting to other patients. If you are in group treatment, it is strongly recommended that you participate in individual therapy at the same time so that you will have a place to talk about the past if you want to.
		</p>
		<h4>
			WILL I HAVE URINE/BREATHALYZER TESTING?
		</h4>
		<p>
			You may be asked to agree to urine and/or breathalyzer testing as part of this treatment. This is the best way for the therapist to know what is truly going on. Unfortunately, part of the problem with substance abuse is that it can lead to lying, even among people who are generally trustworthy. Years of experience in substance abuse treatment suggest that urine testing promotes the best possible care of patients. And many patients say that they feel more able to 
			give up substances when they know they'll be tested. Some patients with trauma histories may have particular concerns about urine testing (e.g., that it will "trigger" them into painful memories of abuse, or will feel demeaning).
			However, a study of this treatment found that virtually all patients were able to do just fine with urine testing once they tried it, and as long as the results were kept confidential.
		</p>
		<h4>
			WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE PARTS OF THE TREATMENT?
		</h4>
		<p>
			The best thing to do is to tell your therapist. Be honest about your comments-it can help to get your needs met, and also to improve the treatment program. Also, at the end of every session, you may be asked to fill out a brief questionnaire about the session. The more comments you make, the more the treatment can be made helpful to you and to other patients in the future! All of your comments will be kept confidential. If you have any concerns about the therapist, the first step is to tell the therapist directly; you can also talk to his or her supervisor, if there is one.
		</p>
		<h4>
			WHO DEVELOPED THE TREATMENT?
		</h4>
		<p>
			The treatment was developed by Lisa Najavits, PhD. She is Associate Professor of Psychiatry (Psychology) at Harvard Medical School; an author of over 60 publications; and recipient of the Chaim Danieli Young Professional Award from the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (1997) and the Early Career Award from the Society for Psychotherapy Research (1998). She is principal investigator on several research studies funded by the National Institutes of Health; past president of the New England Society for Behavior Analysis and Therapy (1998); and on the boards of advisors for the journals Psychotherapy Research, the Journal of Traumatic Stress, and Clinica/ Psychology:
			Science and Practice. She is director of the Trauma Research Program in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment Center at McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA), is a psychotherapy supervisor, and conducts a psychotherapy practice. She received her PhD in clinical psychology from Vanderbilt University and her bachelor's degree from Columbia University.
			You may also be interested to know that she had PTSD after a crime victimization in 1987. If you have comments about this treatment, you can contact her program by phone

		</p>
		<h4>
			WHAT HAS RESEARCH SHOWN SO FAR ABOUT THIS TREATMENT?
		</h4>
		<p>
			This is the first treatment for PTSD and substance abuse that has undergone scientific testing. Based on a sample of 17 patients who participated in a study on the treatment, results showed significant improvements in substance use, trauma-related symptoms, suicide risk, suicidal thoughts, social adjustment, family functioning, problem solving, de-pression, thoughts about substance use, and knowledge related to the treatment. Positive results have also been found in three other studies thus far: a study of women in prison, a study of inner-city women, and a study of men.
			The treatment and the initial research on it are summarized in the following articles:

		<h3>
			How to Get the Most from This Treatment
		</h3>
		<p>
			It is possible to recover from both PTSD and substance abuse, and this treatment is designed to help you do that.
			However, this treatment cannot work without you. Therefore:
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Notice your strengths.</b> Keep actively recognizing your strengths, talents, and abilities. At each session you will be asked to tell at least one example of something you did well (good coping) since the previous session.
			No one gets anywhere by putting oneself down.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Be honest.</b> Lies and secrecy often accompany PTSD and substance abuse, but honesty is the path to recov-ery. In your treatment, be honest about everything: your substance use, your true feelings (both negative and positive), and your reactions to the therapist.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Safety above all.</b> The highest priority is staying safe. In fact, for both trauma and substance abuse, there are several phases of healing. Right now you are in the first stage, establishing safety: getting off all sub-stances, staying alive and not hurting yourself, locating a network of supportive people, learning to cope with day-to-day problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Show up, no matter what.</b> Sometimes you may not want to come to treatment. You may have used a substance and feel ashamed. You may be so depressed that you don't want to get out of bed. Come to treatment anyway. Keep reaching out for the help that is available to you. You can talk about your mixed feelings in the session.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Stay focused on your own goals.</b> Do not compare yourself to other people. You are fighting your own battle. Whether others are doing better or worse does not matter.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Participate.</b> The more you put into something, the more you will get out of it. Work your very hardest-100%. Listen, learn, speak up, read the materials, and try the new strategies being taught. These efforts will pay off!
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Complete commitments between sessions.</b> You will be asked to make a commitment between each ses-sion, to move forward in your recovery. It is up to you what you select, but once you make a commitment, it is important to keep it. Research shows that patients who complete assignments outside of sessions improve three times as much as patients who do not.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Free yourself from substance use.</b> Substances block your feelings and prevent the emotional work needed to recover; they also block your general growth and emotional development. While you may have mixed feelings about giving up substances (a natural reaction at first), keep talking about it in treatment, and keep aiming for freedom from all substances. You will feel more powerful, stronger, and better about yourself. Even if you cannot or do not want to give up substances, come to treatment anyway to obtain help with other problems in your life that you want to work on.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Know that you may feel worse before you feel better.</b> As you stop using substances, you will notice many changes. Some may be wonderful (e.g., increased energy), while others may be difficult (e.g., more depression, physical problems) Hang in there, and these symptoms will go down eventually. "The only way out is through."

		<ul>
			<li>The goal of this treatment is safety above all!</li>
			<li>
				I will try my very hardest to recover, including reading session materials, completing commitments between sessions, and reaching out for all help available to me.

			<li> I am always welcome back, even if I relapse.</li>
			<li> The more I put into treatment, the more I'll get out of it.</li>
			<li>
				I understand that / may feel worse before I feel better, but that I should stick with treatment no matter what.
			</li>
			<li>
				Everything said in treatment will be kept strictly confidential. I am aware, however, that there are certain legal conditions where the therapist is obligated to release records: (1) if I am in serious danger of harming myself or others; (2) if child or elder abuse becomes known; or (3) if a court subpoenas the therapist's records.
			</li>
			<li>
				I will strive to be totally honest with the therapist about my substance use, my safety (including self-harm, suicidal impulses, and danger to others), and any negative reactions I have to the treatment or the therapist.
			</li>
			<li>
				I will be on time for sessions, and will leave a message if I need to cancel.

				In an emergency, I will follow the written emergency instructions I have been given.

		<h3>
			The Brain and PTSD
		</h3>
		<hr class="fade">
		<p>
			Daniel Siegel, M.D., a foremost researcher on the relationship between the brain and the mind, uses the hand as a model for visualizing the brain.
		</p>
		<p>
			With your elbow bent, tuck your thumb in against your palm and wrap your fingers over your thumb. Your forearm represents the spinal column, and the base of the palm is the more primitive part of the brain that governs our physical bodies. The thumb is the midbrain, in which emotions are experienced. The fingers represent the cortex, which is the seat of cognition, where our thoughts are formed. The middle two fingers represent the neocortex, a part of the thinking brain that makes judgments about our own thoughts and behaviors.
		</p>
		<p>
			When a person experiences a trauma or traumas, the brain reacts at all levels. When neurons from the different areas fire together repeatedly, those connections become stronger. After a trauma, neurons fire in a rigid pattern. The way one experiences the trauma, physically, emotionally, and mentally, become rigidified.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dr. Siegel explains that it is possible for our neuronal rigidity to soften, like when pouring warm water over a block of ice, and for our brains to rewire in new ways. This concept is referred to as neuronal plasticity. Dr. Siegel explains that neuronal plasticity is stimulated by such factors as emotional arousal, aerobic exercise, and meditation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The treatment model that we are employing in this program uses writing as a method to unlock some emotions, while at the same challenging the thoughts and judgments we have about the trauma and what the trauma says about us. Participants in our program may find that embarking on a reasonable physical exercise routine while in the program could enhance the effectiveness of the program.

			</li>
			<li>
				Option 2: Start keeping a "journal of successes" (times that you coped safely, obstacles overcome, successes in resisting substance use, coping skills that you used).
			</li>
			<li>
				Option 3: Create an "inspiration book" or "inspiration box" to inspire you to stay safe (including photographs of people you love, songs, poems, quotations, news clippings, etc.).
			</li>
			<li>
				Option 4: Fold the list of Safe Coping Skills in half down the middle. Read the names of the skills on the left side and try to remember what each one means. Give yourself 1 point for each correct answer.
			</li>
			<li>Option 5: Write a paragraph on what "safety" means to you.</li>

			"Although the world is full <br>

		<h2>
			COMPASSION FOR YOUR SUBSTANCE ABUSE
		</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		<p>
			<b>Substance abuse can be understood as a misguided attempt to cope with PTSD and other problems.</b>
			Using substances may have been a way to numb the pain . .. get to sleep . .. escape negative feelings . .. forget about the past . . . get through the day . .. access feelings or memories that you know are there . .. try to feel normal . .. show people how bad you feel because you can't put it into words . .. compensate for your suffering ... give you some pleasure in life .... feel in control ... feel accepted by people . . . get rid of dissociation and flashbacks.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Viewing your substance abuse with compassion does not mean "it's okay to use,</b> or "If I use, I can excuse myself because I was trying to numb the pain." A major goal of this treatment is to eliminate all substance use.
			If you truly view your substance abuse with compassion, you will strive to eliminate it completely because you will see that, in the long run, it brings you only misery and dysfunction. Although it may sometimes work in the short run to
			"self-medicate" problems, it never works in the long run.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Examples of Viewing Substance Abuse with Compassion</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Can't stop using substances</b> <br>
			Harsh view. "I'm such a failure. Look what I turned into-I have no self-control; what a wreck."
			Compassionate view. "My substance abuse has been a way to try to deal with my overwhelming PTSD symp-toms. I've been trying to numb the pain. I now need to learn other ways to cope. Substance abuse is a medical ill-ness, and I need help with it "
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Lying about substance use </b> <br>
			Harsh view: "I'm a no-good liar. I lie to my partner, my kids, my doctor. I hate my life."
			Compassionate view: "I need to stop lying so I can recover. But there are real reasons why I lie about my sub-
			stance abuse: shame, guilt, feeling bad about myself. I need help working on these."
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>* Write a harsh versus compassionate view of your substance abuse.</em>
		</p>
		<p>Harsh view:____________</p>
		<p>Compassionate view:____________</p>
		<h3>
			STRENGTHS FROM ADVERSITY
		</h3>
		<p>
			Another way to view PTSD and substance abuse with compassion is to recognize the strengths you may have developed-the "gifts from suffering." Usually, the most profound growth occurs from overcoming difficult experiences.
			PTSD and substance abuse may have given you the ability to survive under tough conditions . .. imagination and cre ativity . . . depth . . . spirituality .
			sensitivity to others . . . awareness of the extremes in life . . . the ability to persist
			despite pain and setbacks . .. appreciation for animals, children, and people outside the mainstream ... responsiveness to art and nature.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>* Do you notice any personal strengths from your struggles with PTSD and substance abuse?</em>
		</p>

		<h2>
			Long-Term PTSD Problems
		</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		<p>
			This handout is provided for people who are already knowledgeable about PTSD and want additional information about its long-term impact. It can be upsetting to read, so ask your therapist first, and do not read this if you feel too vulnerable right now-you can wait until later in treatment. If you begin to read it and become upset, just stop.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the standard definition of PTSD described in Handout 1, there are other problems that may occur with PTSD, especially for people who have suffered repeated childhood abuse (Herman, 1992). You may have some and

    <h2>What Is PTSD?</h2>
    <hr class="fade">

    <p>
      <b>PTSD stands for "posttraumatic stress disorder"</b>-a set of emotional problems that can occur after someone has experienced a terrible, stressful life event.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PTSD means:</b>
      "post <em>("after")</em> traumatic <em>("trauma")</em> stress <em>("anxiety")</em> disorder <em>("reaction")</em>"
    </p>


    <p> Do you have PTSD? Check off (✓) those below that are true for you.</p>
    <p>
      _1. You survived a trauma: an event outside of your control in which you experienced or witnessed a physical threat (e.g., sexual abuse, physical abuse, war combat, seeing someone killed, surviving a hurricane, a car accident).
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Your response to the trauma involved intense helplessness, fear, or horror (or, if you were a child at the time, agitated or disorganized behavior).
    </p>
    <p>
      _3. After the trauma, you suffered each of the following problems for over a month:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        __  INTRUSION: The trauma comes back into mind even when you don't want it to, as in nightmares,
        flashbacks, or images.
      </li>
      <li>
        __  AVOIDANCE: Numbing, feeling detached, avoiding any reminders of the trauma.
      </li>
      <li>
        __ AROUSAL: Feeling "hyped up" (e.g., easily startled, sleep problems, anger).    
      </li>
      <li>
        __ LOWER FUNCTIONING: Problems with relationships, work, or other major areas of life.
      </li>

      <em>
        Note: You have PTSD if you checked off all of the items above.
      </em>
    </p>
    <h3>
      TYPES OF PTSD
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are two types of PTSD. "Simple PTSD" is from a single incident (such as a car accident or a tornado), usually as an adult. "Complex PTSD" is from repeated incidents such as domestic violence or ongoing childhood abuse. It has a broader range of symptoms, including problems with self-harm, suicide, dissociation ("losing time"), relationships, memory, sexuality, health, anger, shame, guilt, numbness, loss of faith and trust, and feeling damaged.
    </p>
    <h3>
      MORE ABOUT PTSD ...
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Your PTSD symptoms are normal after what you have been through.</b>
        You are not crazy, weak, or bad! That is why PTSD has been called "a normal reaction to abnormal events."
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>PTSD is considered an anxiety disorder</b> because it is marked by an overwhelming feeling of anxiety during or after the trauma. It is a psychiatric illness, but it is definitely possible to heal from it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Rates of PTSD:</b> 61% of men experience trauma during their lives, with 5% developing PTSD; for women, 51% experience trauma, and 10% develop PTSD. Why do some people develop PTSD after trauma and others don't?
        This is not fully known, but some risk factors include more severe, repeated, and/or early trauma; poverty; parents who had PTSD; and life stress.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Knowledge about PTSD is relatively recent.</b> It was first studied in soldiers who experienced combat. Later, it came to be understood in a wide variety of terrible life events (e.g., sexual and physical abuse, natural disasters).
        PTSD was added to the official list of psychiatric disorders only in 1980. More is being learned all the time because it is so important.

    <h2>The Link between PTSD and Substance Abuse</h2>
    <hr class="fade">

    <p>
      PTSD and substance abuse are closely connected for many people, yet this link often goes unrecognized. Below is some information that may be helpful to you.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>You are not alone!</b> For people with substance abuse, PTSD is one of the most common dual diagnoses.
        Among women in treatment for substance abuse, 30%-59% have current PTSD. Among men in substance abuse treatment, 11%-38% have current PTSD.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>There are many reasons why people with PTSD abuse substances:</b> to access feelings or memories, or the opposite to escape from feelings or memories; to get through the day; to compensate for the pain of PTSD; to commit "slow suicide"; because they grew up with substance abuse in the family; because they don't care about taking care of their bodies.  
      </li>
      <li>People with PTSD and substance abuse tend to abuse the most dangerous substances: cocaine and opiates.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Gender differences:</b> Women with PTSD and substance abuse typically experienced childhood physical and/ or sexual abuse; men with both disorders typically experienced crime victimization or war trauma.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Two main themes of both disorders are secrecy and control.</b> "Secrecy" means you may feel ashamed and wish to keep your problems a secret (e.g., the traumas you experienced, the amount of your substance use).
        "Control" refers to the idea that with trauma and substance abuse, you feel out of control. In PTSD, a terrible event occurred that you neither chose nor wanted; in substance abuse, you have lost control over your ability to stop using.
        Learning the skills of honesty and regaining control are thus important for healing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Each of the disorders makes the other more likely.</b> If you have PTSD, you are at increased risk for substance abuse. If you have substance abuse, you are at increased risk for trauma. It is thus important to try to keep yourself safe to prevent further trauma and substance abuse.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The relationship between PTSD and substance abuse is complex.</b> Using substances can either increase or decrease the PTSD symptoms. Yet abstinence from substances can also either increase or decrease the PTSD symp-toms. Try to notice the patterns that occur for you. Getting to know the relationship between the two disorders in your life can help you cope better with the recovery process.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Why do PTSD and substance abuse occur together?</b> Four patterns are common:
        <ol>
          <li>
            PTSD can lead to substance abuse. To overcome the terrible symptoms of PTSD, you may use substances to "self-medicate"-to try to feel better. For example, you may have begun using alcohol to get to sleep at night.
          </li>
          <li>
            Substance abuse can lead to PTSD. If you abuse substances, you may be vulnerable to dangerous traumatic situations because your "guard is down" or your self-esteem is low-for example, getting drunk at a bar and going home with a stranger who assaults you.
          </li>
          <li>
            PTSD and substance abuse may have both occurred together. Some people grew up in a home where family members abused substances and also hurt each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            PTSD and substance abuse can be connected in a "downward spiral." PTSD can lead you to use sub stances; by using substances, you are at increased risk for more trauma; if more trauma happens, you may use more substances 
            to 'cope' ...and so on.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </div>

<h3>Using Compassion to Take Back Your Power</h3>
<hr class="fade">
<p>
<b>Having compassion for your PTSD and substance abuse is a way to "take back your power."</b> One of the most troubling aspects of PTSD and substance abuse is that you feel powerless over them-they are controlling you rather than vou controlling them. "Compassion" means accepting and respecting yourself. The opposite of compassion is harshness. Rather than blaming yourself, the goal is to understand and really listen to yourself at a deep level.
This can make it easier to heal from PTSD and substance abuse.
</p>
<p>
Compassion may feel very difficult to do. It is easier to "beat yourself up" and hate yourself, especially if you grew up in a family where this is how you were treated. With PTSD and substance abuse, you may view yourself as sick, damaged, weak, crazy, bad, or lazy. There may be people in your life who view you in those ways too. However, it is helpful to understand your PTSD and substance abuse as attempts to survive and cope. It has been said that
"these symptoms simultaneously conceal and reveal their origins; they speak in disguised language of secrets too terrible for words" (Herman, 1992, p. 96).
</p>
<p>
<b>This does not mean that the PTSD and substance abuse should continue.</b> Indeed, the major goal of this treatment is to help you overcome PTSD and substance abuse by learning safe ways of coping. But it helps to understand your PTSD and substance abuse as signs of distress. It is like having a fever when you are ill-it tells you that you need to get help and take good care of yourself.
</p>
<h4>
COMPASSION FOR YOUR PTSD
</h4>
<p>
<b>PTSD can be understood as an attempt by your mind and body to survive overwhelming trauma.</b> PTSD symptoms may have helped you to "tune out" the terrible trauma . ... protect yourself from further harm ... feel more in control of an uncontrollable situation . .. feel safer . . . adapt to your environment . .. get people to notice your pain.
</p>
<p>
  <b>
Examples of Viewing PTSD Symptoms with Compassion
</b>
</p>
<p><b>Suicidal thinking</b></p>
<p>
Harsh view. "I'm hopeless. What's wrong with me? I should just get over it already."
Compassionate view. "It's my way to feel more in control, by choosing life or death. In therapy I can learn other
ways to feel control, but suicidal thoughts make sense after what I've lived through."
</p>
<p><b>Relationship problems</b></p>
<p>
Harsh view: "I'm unlovable. I deserved what happened to me. I'm a bad person."
Compassionate view: "I learned not to trust people, and that helped me survive. I can keep working on relationship issues, but I need to be respectful of myself and why I have these problems."
</p>
<p>
* Write a harsh versus compassionate view of your PTSD. (Continue on back for more space.)

  <h1>Grounding: Detaching from Emotional Pain</h1>
  <hr class="fade">
  <article>
    <blockquote>

      "No feeling is final." <br>
      <span> - Rainer Maria Rilke </span>

    </blockquote>


    <h1>Using Grounding to Detach from Emotional Pain</h1>  
    <hr class="fade">

    <h3><b>WHAT IS GROUNDING?</b></h3>
    <p>
      Grounding is a set of simple strategies to detach from emotional pain (e.g., drug cravings, self-harm impulses, anger, sadness. Distraction works by focusing outward on the external world, rather than inward toward the self. You can also think of it as "distraction," "centering." "a safe place," "looking outward," or "healthy detachment."
    </p>

    <h3><b>WHY DO GROUNDING?</b></h3>
    <p>
      When you are overwhelmed with emotional pain, you need a way to detach so that you can gain control over your feelings and stay safe. As long as you are grounding, you cannot possibly use substances or hurt yourself! Grounding "anchors" you to the present and to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people with PTSD and substance abuse struggle with feeling either too much (overwhelming emotions and memories) or too little (numbing and dissociation). In grounding, you attain a balance between the two: conscious of reality and able to tolerate it. Remember that pain is a feeling; it is not who you are. When you get caught up in it, it feels like you are your pain, and that is all that exists. But it is only one part of your experience-the others are just hidden and can be found again through grounding.
    </p>

    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Grounding can be done <b>any time, any place, anywhere </b>, and no one has to know.</li>
      <li>
        Use grounding when you are <b>faced with a trigger, enraged, dissociating, having a substance craving, or whenever your emotional pain goes above 6 (on a 0-10 scale)</b>. Grounding puts healthy distance between you and these negative feelings.
      </li>
      <li><b>Keep your eves open, scan the room, and turn the light on </b>to stay in touch with the present.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Rate your mood before and after grounding</b>, to test whether it worked. Before grounding, rate your level of emotional pain (0-10, where 10 means "extreme pain"). Then rerate it afterward. Has it gone down?
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> No talking about negative feelings or journal writing</b> -you want to distract away from negative feel-ings, not get in touch with them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Stay neutral</b>-avoid judgments of "good" and "bad." For example, instead of "The walls are blue; I dislike blue because it reminds me of depression," simply say "The walls are blue" and move on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Focus on the present, not the past or future.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Note that grounding is not the same as relaxation training</b>. Grounding is much more active, focuses on distraction strategies, and is intended to help extreme negative feelings. It is believed to be more effective than relaxation training for PTSD.
      </li>
    </ul>



    <h3>WAYS OF GROUNDING</h3>

    <p>Three major ways of grounding are described below-mental, physical, and soothing. "Mental" means focusing your mind; "physical" means focusing on your senses (e.g., touch, hearing); and "soothing" means talking to yourself in a very kind way. You may find that one type works better for you, or all types may be helpful.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Mental Grounding
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b> Describe your environment in detail</b>, using all your senses--for example, "The walls are white; there are five pink chairs; there is a wooden bookshelf against the wall..." Describe objects, sounds, textures, colors, smells,
        shapes, numbers, and temperature. You can do this anywhere. For example, on the subway: "I'm on the subway. I'II see the river soon. Those are the windows. This is the bench. The metal bar is silver. The subway map has four colors." 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Play a "categories" game with yourself</b>. Try to think of "types of dogs," "jazz musicians," "states that begin with 'A'," "cars," "TV shows," "writers," "sports," "songs," or "cities."
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Do an age progression</b>. If you have regressed to a younger age (e.g., 8 years old), you can slowly work your way back up (e.g., "I'm now 9; I'm now 10; I'm now 11 ... ") until you are back to your current age.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Describe an everyday activity in great detail</b>. For example, describe a meal that you cook (e.g., "First I peel the potatoes and cut them into quarters; then I boil the water; then I make an herb marinade of oregano, basil, garlic, and olive oil ... ").
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Imagine</b>. Use an image: Glide along on skates away from your pain; change the TV channel to get to a better show; think of a wall as a buffer between you and your pain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Say a safety statement</b>. "My name is _____; I am safe right now. I am in the present, not the past. I am
        located in____; the date is ____."
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Read something, saying each word to yourself</b>. Or read each letter backward so that you focus on the letters and not on the meaning of words.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Use humor</b>. Think of something funny to jolt yourself out of your mood.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Count to 10 or say the alphabet</b>, very s ... I ... o ... W ... I . . . y.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Physical Grounding</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Run cool or warm water over your hands.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Grab. tightly onto your chair as hard as you can.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Touch various objects around you:</b> a pen, keys, your clothing, the table, the walls. Notice textures, colors, materials, weight, temperature. Compare objects you touch: Is one colder? Lighter?
      </li>
      <li>

        <b>Dig your heels into the floor</b>-literally "grounding" them! Notice the tension centered in your heels as you do this. Remind yourself that you are connected to the ground.
      </li>
      <li>

        <b>Carry a grounding object in your pocket</b>--a small object (a small rock, clay, a ring, a piece of cloth or yarn) that you can touch whenever you feel triggered.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Jump up and down.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Notice your body:</b> the weight of your body in the chair; wiggling your toes in your socks; the feel of your back against the chair. You are connected to the world.
      </li>
      <li><b>Stretch</b>. Extend your fingers, arms, or legs as far as you can; roll your head around.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Clench and release your fists.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Walk slowly, noticing each footstep</b>, saying "left" or "right" with each step.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Eat something, describing the flavors</b> in detail to yourself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Focus on your breathing</b>, noticing each inhale and exhale. Repeat a pleasant word to yourself on each inhale (e.g., a favorite color, or a soothing word such as "safe" or "easy").
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Soothing Grounding</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Say kind statements,</b> as if you were talking to a small child-for example, "You are a good person going through a hard time. You'll get through this."
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Think of favorites.</b> Think of your favorite color, animal, season, food, time of day, TV show.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Picture people you care about</b> (e.g., your children), and look at photographs of them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Remember the words to an inspiring song, quotation, or poem</b> that makes you feel better (e.g., the
        AA Serenity Prayer).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Remember a safe place.</b> Describe a place that you find very soothing (perhaps the beach or mountains, or a favorite room); focus on everything about that place--the sounds, colors, shapes, objects, textures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Say a coping statement:</b> ' can handle this," "This feeling will pass."
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Plan a safe treat for yourself,</b> such as a piece of candy, a nice dinner, or a warm bath.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Think of things you are looking forward to in the next week</b>-perhaps time with a friend, going to a movie, or going on a hike.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      WHAT IF GROUNDING DOES NOT WORK?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Grounding does work! But, like any other skill, you need to practice to make it as powerful as possible. Below are suggestions to help make it work for you.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Practice as often as possible,</b> even when you don't need it, so that you'll know it by heart.</li>
      <li><b>Practice faster.</b> Speeding up the pace gets you focused on the outside world quickly.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Try grounding for a looooooonnnnngggg time (20-30 minutes)</b>. And repeat, repeat, repeat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Try to notice which methods you like best</b>-physical, mental, or soothing grounding methods, or some combination.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Create your own methods of grounding</b>. Any method you make up may be worth much more than those you read here, because it is yours.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Start grounding early in a negative mood cycle.</b> Start when a substance craving just starts or when you have just started having a flashback. Start before anger gets out of control.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Make up an index card</b> on which you list your best grounding methods and how long to use them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Have others assist you in grounding.</b> Teach friends or family about grounding, so that they can help guide you with it if you become overwhelmed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare in advance. Locate places at home, in your car, and at work where you have materials and reminders for grounding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Create a cassette tape of a grounding message</b> that you can play when needed. Consider asking your therapist or someone close to you to record it if you want to hear someone else's voice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Think about why grounding works.</b> Why might it be that by focusing on the external world, you become more aware of an inner peacefulness? Notice the methods that work for you-why might those be more powerful for you than other methods?
      </li>
      <li><b>Don't give up!</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ideas for a Commitment</h2>
    <hr class="fade">
    <p>
      Commit to one action that will move your life forward!
      It can be anything you feel will help you, or you can try one of the ideas below.
      Keeping your commitment is a way of respecting, honoring, and caring for yourself.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        + Option 1: Practice grounding for 10 minutes or more, rating your feelings before and after just as we did in the session).
      </li>
      <li>
        + Option 2: Reread the handout, circling the methods that you most want to try.
      </li>
      <li>
        Option 3: Find something to carry with you that helps you feel grounded (e.g., a small, beautiful rock; a picture of someone you love; an A chip you earned). Keep it in a place that you can access at any time, such as in your pocket or wallet, or on your key chain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Option 4: Fill out the Safe Coping Sheet.

      <h2>Cognitive Triad</h2>
      <p>
        Mindfulness skills are very important skills because they get us present in the moment. We can begin to label and notice our feelings and thoughts. However, the question arises, what to do next? This next section explore the relationship between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and how if we are able to change one of these, then we are often able to improve our mood and/or make better choices for ourselves.

<h3><b>Exploring Thoughts/Feelings/Behaviors</b></h3>
<p>
  Most of us go about our business without much attention to why we are doing things.
  Mindfulness allows us to slow down and explore in depth the relationship between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. When we do this, we begin to see the interrelationship between these three things.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, most depressed people have the following thoughts, "Life is hopeless. Why bother to do anything. It's no use." This leads to a feeling of heaviness and sadness, which leads to inaction and withdrawal from others. This behavior leads to more thoughts of hopelessness and futility, which leads to more depressed mood, which leads to more inaction, etc. Each part of the circle reinforces the others.
</p>
<p>
  A typical pattern of thoughts/feelings and behaviors can be constructed for most common emotions..

  <li> <b>Discounting the positives:</b> You insist that your accomplishments or positive qualities don't count.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Jumping to conclusions: </b>(A)<b> Mind-reading</b>--you assume that people are reacting negatively to you when there's no definite evidence;
    (B) <b>Fortune-telling</b>--you arbitrarily predict that things will furn out badly.
  </li>
  <li><b>Magnification or minimization: </b>You blow things way out of proportion or you shrink their importance.</li>

    <b>"Should statements": </b>You criticize yourself (or other people) with "shoulds," "oughts," "musts" and "have tos."
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Labeling:</b> Instead of saying "I made a mistake," you tell yourself, "I'm a jerk," or "a fool." or "a loser."  
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Personalization and blame: </b>You blame yourself for something you weren't entirely responsible for, or you blame other people and deny your role in the problem.
  </li>

<h2>Ideas for a Commitment</h2>
<hr class="fade">
<p>
  Commit to one action that will move your life forward!
  It can be anything you feel will help you, or you can try one of the ideas below.
  Keeping your commitment is a way of respecting, honoring, and caring for yourself.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Option 1: Take one harmful meaning from the handout and write out in detail how you can respond to it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Option 2: Describe and name a meaning that you have observed in yourself or others that is not already on the handout.  
  </li>
  <li>
    Option 3: Identify one major meaning that gives your life purpose (e.g., your children? your job? your spiritu-ality? your recovery?). Write out how that meaning can help keep you focused on your recovery.  
  </li>
  <li>
    Option 4: Write out how you can talk to yourself the next time you feel like doing something that is unsafe.  
  </li>
  <li>
    Option 5: Fill out the Safe Coping Sheet. (See below for an example applied to this topic.)

	<h1>Setting Boundaries in Relationships</h1>
	<hr class="fade">
	<article>

		<blockquote>
			"Let your heart guide you. <br>
			It whispers, so listen closely."

			<span>   
				-Molly Goode
			</span>
			<span>(20th-century American writer)</span>
		</blockquote>
		<h2>Healthy Boundaries</h2>
		<p>
			Healthy boundaries are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Flexible. You are able to be both close and distant, adapting to the situation. You are able to let go of relationships that are destructive. You are able to connect with relationships that are nurturing.
			</li>
			<li>
				Safe. You are able to protect yourself against exploitation by others. You are able to read cues that someone is abusive or selfish
			</li>
			<li>Connected. You are able to engage in balanced relationships with others and maintain them over time. As conflicts arise, you are able to work them out.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Both PTSD and substance abuse can result in unhealthy boundaries.</b> In PTSD, your boundaries (your body and your emotions) were violated by trauma. It may be difficult for you now to keep good boundaries in relation-ships. In substance abuse, you have lost boundaries with substances (you use too much, and may act in ways you normally would not, such as getting high and saying things you don't mean). Learning to establish healthy boundaries is an essential part of recovery from both disorders.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Boundaries are a problem when they are too close or too distant.</b>
		</p>

		<p>Boundaries can be too close (letting people in too much; enmeshed). * Do you:</p>
		<ul class="boundaries-checkList">
			<li><a>Have difficulty saying "no" in relationships?</a></li>
			<li><a>Give too much?</a></li>
			<li><a>Get involved too quickly?</a></li>
			<li><a>Trust too easily?</a></li>
			<li><a>Intrude on others (e.g., violate other people's boundaries)?</a></li>
			<li><a>Stay in relationships too long?</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Boundaries can be too distant (not letting people in enough; detached). * Do you:
		</p>
		<ul class="boundaries-checkList">
			<li><a>Have difficulty saying "yes" in relationships?</a></li>
			<li><a>Isolate?</a></li>
			<li><a>Feel lonely?</a></li>
			<li><a>Stay in relationships too briefly?</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>	
			<em>Note that many people have difficulties in both areas.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Boundary problems are a misdirected attempt to beloved.</b> By "giving all" to people, you are trying to win them over; instead, you teach them to exploit you. By isolating from others, you may be trying to protect yourself, but then don't obtain the support you need.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Healthy boundaries can keep you safe.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Learning to say "no" can . .. keep you from getting AIDS (saying "no" to unsafe sex); keep you from using substances (saying "no" to substances); prevent exploitation (saying "no" to unfair demands); protect you from abusive relationships and domestic violence.
		</p>
		<p>
			Learning to say "yes" can . .. allow you to rely on others; let yourself be known to others; help you feel sup-ported; get you through tough times.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Setting good boundaries prevents extremes in relationships.</b> By setting boundaries, you can avoid painful extremes: too close versus too distant, giving too much versus too little, idealizing versus devaluing others. Neither extreme is healthy; balance is crucial.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>It is important to set boundaries with yourself as well as with others.</b>
			You may have difficulty saying "no" to yourself. For example, you promise yourself you won't smoke pot, but then you do. You may overindulge in food, sex, or other addictions. You may say you won't go back to an abusive partner, but then you do.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may have difficulty saying "yes" to yourself. For example, you may deprive yourself too much by not eating enough, working too hard, not taking time for yourself, or not allowing yourself pleasure.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>People with difficulty setting boundaries may violate other people's boundaries as well.</b> This may appear as setting up "tests" for other people, intruding into other people's business, trying to control others, or being verbally or physically abusive.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>If you physically hurt yourself or others, you need immediate help with boundaries.</b> Hurting yourself or others is an extreme form of boundary violation. It means that you act out your emotional pain through physical abuse. Work with your therapist to set a Safety Contract. (See the topic Healing from Anger for more on this.)
		</p>

		<h2>Too Much Closeness: Learning to Say "No" in Relationships</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		<p>
			Why is it important to say "no"? It means setting a limit to protect yourself in relationships. For example, "If you show up with coke, I'm leaving," or "Unless you stop yelling at me, I'm walking out." Saying "no" is an important skill for setting boundaries. At a deeper level, setting boundaries is a way of conveying that both people in a relationship deserve care and attention. It is a healthy way of respecting your separate identity.
		</p>
		<h3>SITUATIONS WHERE YOU CAN LEARN TO SAY "NO"</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Refusing drugs and alcohol.</li>
			<li>Pressure to say more than you want to.</li>
			<li>Going along with things that you do not want to do.</li>
			<li>When you're taking care of everyone but you.</li>
			<li>When you do all the giving in a relationship.</li>
			<li>When you make promises to yourself that you do not keep.</li>
			<li>When you're doing things that take your focus away from recovery.</li>

		<h3>HOW TO SAY "NO"</h3>
		<p><b><em>* Try different ways to set a boundary:</em></b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Polite refusal: "No thanks, I'd rather not."</li>
			<li>Insistence: "No, I really mean it, and I'd like to drop the subiect."</li>
			<li>Partial honesty: "I cannot drink because I have to drive."</li>
			<li>Full honesty: "I cannot drink because I'm an alcoholic."</li>
			<li>Stating consequences: "If you keep bringing drugs home, I will have to move out."</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>	<em>* Remember that it is a sign of respect to say "no." </em></b>Protecting yourself is part of developing self-respect.
			Rather than driving people away, it helps them value you more. You can be vulnerable without being exploited. You can enjoy relationships without fearing them. In healthy relationships, saying "no" appropriately promotes closeness.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b><em>* How much or how little you say is up to you.</em></b> However, if you can comfortably provide an explanation, this can make it easier on the other person.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><em>* You will find the words if you are motivated to say "no."</em></b> Once you commit to protecting your needs, the how will present itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><em>* Take care of yourself; let others take care of themselves.</em></b> You can only live your life, not theirs.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><em>* If you are afraid of hurting the other person,</em></b> remember that it may take repeated work, both with the other person and within yourself. Over time, you will realize that healthy people can tolerate hearing what you think and feel.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><em>* You can set a boundary before, during, or after an interaction with someone.</em></b> Try discussing a difficult topic beforehand (e.g., discuss safe sex before a sexual encounter), during an interaction (e.g., try saying "no" to alcohol when it is offered), or afterward (e.g., go back and tell someone you did not like being talked to abusively).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><em>* Be careful about how much you reveal.</em></b> PTSD and substance abuse are sensitive topics, and discrimination against these disorders is very real and harmful. You can never take back a statement once it has been said. You do not need to be open with people you do not know well, people in work settings, or people who are abusive to you.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><em>* Be extremely careful if there is a possibility of physical harm.</em></b> Seek professional guidance.
		</p>

		<h3>ROLE PLAYS FOR SAYING "NO"</h3>
		<p>
			<em>* Try rehearsing the following situations out loud. What could you say?</em>
		</p>
		<p><b>With Others</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>You are at a holiday party and your boss says, "Let's celebrate! Have a drink!"</li>
			<li>Your partner says you should "just get over your trauma already."</li>
			<li>A friend tells you not to take psychiatric medications because "that's substance abuse too.</li>
			<li>Your sister wants to know all about your trauma, but you don't feel ready to tell her.</li>
			<li>Your partner keeps drinking around you, saying "You need to learn to deal with it."</li>
			<li>Your date says, "Let's go to my place," and you don't want to.</li>
			<li>Your boss gives you more and more work, and it's too much.</li>
			<li>You suspect that your uncle is abusing your daughter.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>With Yourself</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>You want to have "just one drink."</li>
			<li>You keep taking care of others but not yourself.</li>
			<li>You promised to stop bingeing on food but keep doing it.</li>

		<h3>HOW TO SAY "YES"</h3>
		<p>
			<b><em>* Try different ways:</em></b>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Share an activity: "Would you like to go to a movie with me?"</li>
			<li>Say how you feel: "I feel so alone; it is hard for me to talk about this."</li>
			<li>Focus on the other person: "Tell me about your struggles with cocaine."</li>
			<li>Watch how others do it: Go to a gathering and listen to others relate.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>* Plan for rejection.</b> Everyone gets rejected at times. It is a normal part of life. Let go of that person and move on to someone else who might be available.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Practice in advance, if possible.</b> Therapy may be a safe place to rehearse.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>* Choose safe people.</b> Select people who are friendly and supportive.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Know that it's normal to make mistakes along the way.</b> It will feel uncomfortable to reach out to others at first. Allow yourself room to grow-it will get easier over time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Set goals.</b> Keep yourself moving forward by making a clear plan, just as you would in other areas of your life.
			Decide to make one social call a week, or try one new meeting a week.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Recognize that you may feel very "young."</b> Parts of you may feel vulnerable, like a child who is just learning how to relate to people. That is expected, as parts of you may not have had a chance to develop due to PTSD or substance abuse.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Start small.</b> Start with a simple event (e.g., saying hello or smiling) rather than a huge one (e.g., asking someone out on a date).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Notice what you have in common rather than how you are different.</b> Work hard to see your similarities with others; this can make it easier to connect.
		</p>
		<h3>

		<h3>
			HOW TO DETACH FROM DAMAGING RELATIONSHIPS
		</h3>
		<p>
			If you have difficulty with boundaries, you may not notice dangerous cues in others. This makes sense if you lived in a past in which a veil of silence was imposed, you were not allowed to express your feelings, or you could not tell others about your trauma. You may need to make special efforts now to notice your reactions to people and to learn when to end relationships that are hurtful.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> If someone doesn't "get it," give up for now.</b> In early recovery, don't waste your energy on changing other people; just focus on helping yourself. If someone doesn't understand you after you've tried to communicate directly, kindly, and repeatedly, find other people.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Even if you cannot leave a damaging relationship, you can still detach from it.</b> If it is someone you must see (such as a family member), protect yourself by not talking to that person about vulnerable topics, such as your trauma or your recovery.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> If enough reasonable people tell you a relationship is bad, listen to them.</b> You may feel so confused or controlled that you have lost touch with your own needs. Listen to others.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>It's better to be alone than in a destructive relationship.</b> It may be that for now, your only safe relationships are with treaters. That's okay.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Destructive relationships can be as addictive as drugs.</b> If you cannot stay away from someone you know is bad for you, you may be addicted to that person. Destructive relationships may feel familiar, and you may be drawn to them over and over if your main relationships in life were exploitative. The best strategy is the same as for all addictions: Actively force yourself to stay away, no matter how hard it feels to do so.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Remember that you are no longer a child, forced to endure bad relationships.</b> You have choices.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Recognize the critical urgency of detaching from bad relationships.</b> They impair your recovery from
			PTSD and substance abuse. They prevent you from taking care of yourself and others (e.g., children).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Once you make a decision to leave a damaging relationship, the "how" will present itself.</b> If you do not know how to leave, it usually means that you have not yet made the decision to leave.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> If you feel guilty, remember that it is your life to live.</b> You can decide how to live it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Expect fallout.</b> When you leave a bad relationship, others may become angry or dangerous. Find ways to protect yourself, including the support of people "on your side," your treatment team, and a shelter if necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> You do not have to explain yourself to the other person;</b> you can just leave.

			Boundary Problems Associated with PTSD and Substance Abuse
		</h2>
		<hr class="fade"></hr>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> Some people become upset when reading the list below. Only read it if you feel safe to do so, and stop if it is too upsetting.
		</p>
		<p>
			People with PTSD and substance abuse may be prone to boundary problems, such as the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Extremes: trusting too much or too little; isolation or enmeshment.</li>
			<li> Relationships that are brittle (easily damaged, fragile).</li>
			<li>Tolerating others' flaws too much; doing anything to preserve the relationship.</li>
			<li>Use of substances as an attempt to connect with others.</li>
			<li> Avoiding relationships because they are too painful.</li>
			<li> Overcompliance at times; too much resistance at other times.</li>
			<li> Always being the one to give.</li>
			<li> Spending time with unsafe people.</li>
			<li> Not seeing the hostility in others' words or actions.</li>
			<li>Being overly angry, with a hair-trigger temper; often ready to "blow up."</li>
			<li> Difficulty expressing feelings; expressing them in actions rather than words (acting out).</li>
			<li> May respect men for being "strong" and disrespect women for being "weak."</li>
			<li> Feeling that one can never get over a loss; not knowing how to mourn; fear of abandonment.</li>
			<li>Difficulty getting out of bad relationships.</li>
			<li> Confusion between fear and attraction (ie., feeling excited when it is really fear).</li>
			<li>Relationships with people who use substances.</li>
			<li> Living for someone else rather than yourself.</li>
			<li> Manipulation: guilt, threats, or lying.</li>
			<li>Reenactments: getting involved in repeated destructive relationship patterns (e.g., recreating the trauma roles of abuser, bystander, victim, rescuer, or accomplice).</li>
			<li>"Stockholm Syndrome": feeling attachment and love for the abuser.</li>
			<li> Wanting to be rescued; wanting others to take responsibility for the relationship.</li>
			<li>Confusion about what is appropriate in relationships: What can one rightly expect of others? When should a relationship end? How much should one give in a relationship? Is it okay to say "no" to others?</li>
			<li>"Identification with the aggressor": believing the abuser is right.</li>

			Exploring Anger
		</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		<h3>
			DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANGER?
		</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Do you think you have a problem with anger?</b> Yes / No / Unsure
		</p>
		<p>
			* If you circled "Yes," you may want to go directly to the next section. If you are unsure, check (V) below any that are true for you-these are typical signs of an anger problem. 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You "blow up" at others.</li>
			<li>You often criticize others.</li>
			<li>You feel anger but can't express it.</li>
			<li>You have impulses to harm others.</li>

			<li>You often isolate.</li>
			<li>You feel bitter.</li>
			<li>You have impulses to harm yourself.</li>

		</ol>
		<h3>
			TWO TYPES OF ANGER
		</h3>
		<p>
			It is important to know that anger is not bad or wrong. Rather, it is information that can be used either to help or to harm your recovery. It can be used constructively to help you heal, to be honest with others, to face your pain. Or it can be used destructively to act out against yourself or others, to give up, to become bitter. Anger itself is not a prob-lem-it's all in what you do with it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Constructive Anger: Anger that Heals</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			"Constructive anger" means anger that is ...
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Moderate or lower (e.g., up to 5 on a 0-10 scale, where 0 = no anger and 10 = intense anger).</li>
			<li>Explored to understand yourself and others better.</li>
			<li>Conscious (vou are aware of it).</li>
			<li>Handled well (e.g., not acted out in dangerous behavior).</li>
			<li>Respectful of your own and others' needs.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>	For example,</b> if you go out on a date and the other person acts selfish, you may rightly feel angry. If you listen to your anger, you can use it as a sign to protect yourself; perhaps you can talk to the person about what bothers you, or you can calmly end the date early. You can feel good about using your anger constructively.
			<b>There are great benefits to constructive anger.</b> It can help protect you from danger . .. convey insights about yourself and others . .. give you real power. <em>* Any other benefits you notice?</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Destructive Anger: Anger that Harms
		</p>
		<p>
			"Destructive anger" means anger that is
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Acted out in dangerous behavior (hurting yourself or others).</li>
			<li>Too intense and/or frequent (e.g., often above a 5 on a 0-10 scale).</li>
			<li>"Underground" (quietly seething or feeling bitter).</li>
			<li>Unconscious.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<b>There are great costs to destructive anger.</b> It can destroy your relationships . .. cause physical harm weaken you ... become an addiction. <em>* Any other costs you notice?</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Destructive anger can be directed toward yourself and/or directed toward others.</b> Both represent a lack of balance between your own and others needs. For some people, both are present.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Destructive anger toward self</b> (e.g., self-harm, suicidal feelings): Putting others' needs too much ahead of yours.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Destructive anger toward others </b>(e.g., verbal abuse, assault): Putting your needs too much ahead of others'.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>With destructive anger toward yourself, you may not be aware of anger.</b> For example, if you physically hurt yourself you may not notice anger at the time. However, such acting out does indeed represent anger-typically anger toward others that you have difficulty "owning."
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>* How do you tend to handle anger? </em><br> 
			Circle one: Constructively / Destructively / Both <br>
			Circle one: Toward self / Toward others / Both
		</p>
		<h2>
			DID YOU KNOW...?
		</h2>
		<p><em>* Check (V) any points below that you understand. Circle any that you have questions about.</em></p>

		<p>
			<b>Anger is normal in recovery from PTSD and substance abuse.</b> If you have been through the terrible experiences of trauma and substance abuse, anger is inevitable. You may feel angry at people who hurt you, at the world, at God, at yourself, at life, at treaters, at family, at strangers. Your anger is valid and real. In recovery, the goal is to use your anger as a way to learn about yourself and grow. The task is to face your anger without letting it destroy you or others.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Behind all anger are unmet needs.</b> Anger is a signal that something is wrong. It may mean that you are not taking enough care of yourself, or that you have a lot of sadness to work through, or that you are in a harmful rela-tionship. Listening to your anger and caring for the underlying needs can resolve anger.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Constructive anger can be learned.</b> It is never too late, no matter how long you've had a problem with an-ger. Mainly, it requires really listening to others' feedback about your anger, "owning" your feelings rather than acting them out, expressing anger in healthy ways, and learning to tolerate the painful feelings behind the anger.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Destructive anger can become an addiction.</b> Can you see similarities between destructive anger and substance abuse? For example, the more you engage in it, the more it increases. Also, with destructive anger you may feel "high" on it in the moment. Have you "hit bottom" with destructive anger--has it caused serious problems in your life?
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Venting anger does not work.</b> An old-style view of anger was the idea of venting--that the solution to anger is to "get it out" (e.g., punch a pillow, write an angry letter, throw rocks at a tree). However, these actually tend to increase rather than decrease anger. Currently, it is understood that anger needs to be handled constructively, not simply vented.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Destructive anger never works in the long term.</b> You may get results in the short term. People may do what you want; you may feel powerful in the moment. It is only later that you can see that these are an illusion. Destructive anger spins you out of control and weakens your bonds with others.
		</p>

		<h2>Understanding Anger</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		<p>
			Notice how each constructive view on the right side of the list below softens the anger. Destructive anger is rigid and harsh. You may want to think of it as ice that needs to melt. The goal is to keep perspective, balance your own and others' needs, and understand yourself better. Also, don't feel you have to agree with each view below-just use the ones that work for you.

		<h2>Before, During, and After: Three Ways to Heal Anger</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		<p>
			To transform anger from destruction to healing, three key strategies are helpful: <b>"Motivate,"</b> 
			<b> "Contain,</b> and <b>"Listen."</b> These correspond, generally, to
			<b> "before,"</b> <b> "during,"</b> and "after" destructive anger episodes. If you want, you can remember the acronym <b>"MCL"</b> or <b>"More Caring Life"</b> to represent the idea that handling anger well can help you take better care of yourself and others.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>
				* Note: If you tend to harm yourself, you may not be aware of your anger. In reading the material below, you can substitute the term "self-harm" where it says "anger."
			</em>
		</p>
		<h3>
			BEFORE ANGER EPISODES ... MOTIVATE
		</h3>
		<p>
			"Motivate" means searching your heart for compelling reasons to stop destructive anger. This can free you to handle the anger constructively. Prepare now, before the next anger episode.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Why?</b> When you are in the midst of destructive anger, it may feel "right" to do something you will later regret.
			Whether it's hurting yourself or someone else, the feelings are so strong that you may feel you have no choice except to go with them. They are like a tidal wave. Think of all the times you've sworn "things will be different next time"-but then they aren't. The only way to make them different is to establish strong motivation and then work at it. It will not happen on its own. A key question: Why is it in your best interest to solve your anger problem?
		</p>
		<p>
			<em><b>How? * </b>Check off any ideas below that might help you.</em>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Observe the cost of your anger.</b> Has it isolated you? Kept you from feeling at peace? Hurt your job perfor-mance? Left scars on your body (from self-harm)?
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Get feedback about your anger.</b> Hearing how others view your anger problem can give you important in-formation. Becoming defensive or dismissing feedback keeps you stuck. You do not have to agree with others, but listen very carefully before you decide what's true.	
			</li> 
			<li>
				<b>Feel the impact of anger on your body.</b> People who get angry a lot are more likely to have physical problems and to die younger. Do you notice the intense stress that anger puts on your body? Can you feel the tension it creates?	
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Notice whom vour anger has hurt.</b> Yourself? Your partner? Your children? Your therapy relationship? Anger scares people, even if they cannot tell you that. See the other's pain-the hurt look on a child's face, the partner who becomes quiet. If you are feeling empathy for someone, you cannot simultaneously harm that person. (That includes yourself too!) Remember that you cannot "unstab" someone once the damage is done.	
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Develop a policy on anger.</b> Make a commitment to yourself (and your therapist or sponsor) that no matter what happens, you will not act on your anger. Handout 4 is a Safety Contract you can fill out.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Imagine how it would feel to control your anger.</b> Picture how extraordinary it would be- freeing, truthful at the deepest level, caring, in control. In the long run, it will feel like a new life. It is "intoxicating" in the best sense.	
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Learn more about anger.</b> This is one of the best ways to motivate yourself. Take a class on anger management or assertiveness-local adult education programs and/or mental health clinics offer such courses. Or read a book on it (two are listed in Handout 5). Learn when and how to express anger, and what to do if the other person does not respond well. You can also ask others how they handle angry situations. Find out what is realistic to expect from people and from ourself (often your anger derives from unrealistic expectations).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Create an image to help you.</b> A horse being reined in? A child being raised? An athlete in training? Really picture the process that's required to learn how to control your anger--the ups and downs.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Carry an "anger reminder."</b> Carry a physical reminder of how destructive your anger can be-for example, a photo of someone you've hurt with your anger, or a list of the hospitalizations you've had for suicidal behavior.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Get rid of weapons until you are safe to keep them.</b> Keeping weapons that can be used against oneself or others is dangerous (e.g., guns, ropes). Until you can express anger in constructive ways without acting out, it is essential to keep your environment as free as possible of weapons. They are disasters waiting to happen.	
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<em>
				* Write out your motivation for working on anger. Make it clear, compelling, and realistic.
				"Own your anger!"
			</em>
		</p>
		<h3>DURING ANGER EPISODES ... CONTAIN</h3>
		<p>
			Once destructive anger has begun, the only goal is to bring it back to the "safe zone"-aware of it, but keeping it within a manageable level (no higher than a 5 on a 0-10 scale).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Why?</b> Destructive anger can blind you. It makes you unable to get perspective or improve the situation. Only once you are in control of anger can you put it to positive use. Thus, when you are feeling the impulse to act on an-ger-to say something you'll later regret, to hurt someone--the only priority is to regain safety. Do not try to explore the anger, understand it, or express it (all that's for later). Think of an "emergency response system" or "damage con-trol." For example, when there is a toxic industrial spill, the goal is to contain it, get people to safety, clear the area, and only figure out why later on. Remember that controlling your anger does not mean your anger is wrong. Your anger is a valid, important feeling that comes from somewhere important. But how it gets addressed--not hurting yourself or others--is just as important. Each time you are able to contain your anger, you are building strength. It will get easier over time!
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>	How?</b> <em> * Check off any ideas below that might help you.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Delay or "time out."</b> This is one of the most effective strategies. No matter what, force yourself to delay any anger expression or action until you're back in the safe zone. Delay for at least a half hour--it has been found that it takes the body at least 20-30 minutes to return to normal once anger has been activated.
			* Do soothing activities. These might be music, meditation, relaxation, sports, reading, TV, praying, ground-ing, sex, or hobbies.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Do activities that help you feel in control.</b> These counteract the out-of-control feeling of destructive an-ger. They include cleaning your room, writing a list of things to do, going shopping, searching the Web, or any other productive activity that is not too stressful for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Notice what you're grateful for.</b> Notice what you do have in life, and what others have done for you. For example, think, "I have a job, a car, my health." Or "I am lucky I have enough to eat every day." Or "I am seeing improvements in my life, such as more days clean."
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Apply the twelve steps of AA to your destructive anger.</b> Give yourself up to your Higher Power for help.
			Think of destructive anger as an addiction.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Remember "clear thinking."</b> Clear thinking means saying statements to yourself that remind you to keep perspective. See Understanding Anger (Handout 2).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>See the good in people.</b> For anger toward others: Try to identify--right now-anything you can that is good about the person you are angry at; if you can do this, notice whether your anger goes down a little. For anger toward yourself: Try to identify anything that is good about you.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Ask for help.</b> Try to identify someone you can call when you feel like hurting yourself or others. It may take others' helo before vou can stop yourself, once the feeling builds (just as with cravings for substances. If you have no one to call, try using a hotline.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>If you are unaware of your anger, try to become conscious.</b> Sometimes people physically hurt themselves but are not aware of any anger. It has gone "underground." Your goal in such situations is to notice your an-ger. This too is a form of containment- conscious anger is much safer than unconscious anger. Ways to do this in-clude, Ask yourself, "Who am I angry with?" and "What am I afraid will happen if I express anger?"
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Remember the bottom line: It is not okay to act out anger.</b> It is never okay to physically hurt someone (unless vou or others are in life-threatening danger). Never attack someone weaker than yourself (e.g., a child, an an-imal, an elderly person). No matter what someone says or does to you, it is your responsibility to manage your anger.
			Do not justify angry outbursts-they harm others and degrade you. And never leave a trail of anger, such as an angry voice mail or an angry letter. Wait until you're calmer to express your anger (see the next section, "Listen").
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Remember your rights.</b> You have a right to feel angry, but you do not have a right to abuse others or your-self. You have a right to leave a relationship, but you do not have a right to stay and hurt someone. If you cannot accept the other person, consider detaching from the relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Stay humble.</b> Much of what fuels anger is a feeling of righteousness. Notice that everyone, including you, makes mistakes in life. Make a list of the mistakes you've made toward others, and read it the next time you feel like blowing up at someone.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Write out your plan for <b>containing </b>destructive anger. Make sure it fits who you are and what most helps you.</em>
		</p>
		<h3>
			AFTER ANGER EPISODES... LISTEN
		</h3>
		<p>
			The next major step in healing from anger is listening to it. This means respecting that your anger comes from somewhere important; it signifies a message that needs to be heard.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Why?</b> Behind all anger are unmet needs. Hear the "whisper" behind the anger. If you try to push it away without looking at it, it will keep coming back. Note that listening is meant broadly; it means both listening to yourself and getting others to listen to you. The key step is for you to hear it clearly-if you can hear it, vou can learn to express it clearly to others too. And if you can hear it clearly, you can then work to get your needs met in effective ways.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>How?</b><em> * Check off any ideas below that might help you.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Listen to the most vulnerable sides of yourself.</b> Destructive anger is like a small child throwing a tan-trum-a vulnerable child who feels scared, sad, alone, guilty or powerless, for example. Indeed, it is said that anger is often a defense against feelings that are more painful. An essential task of recovery is to respect these feelings and soothe yourself through them.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Listen to your anger messages.</b> Some typical messages that anger conveys include, "Others are not hearing me," "I have suffered too much." " want the world to be a better place." " don't have enough support," "I feel hopeless," "I feel like a failure," "Other people have it easier."
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Notice patterns.</b> Does your anger occur when you feel hurt? When you are tired or hungry? When others are incompetent? When you have been working too hard? When you feel rejected? When others place demands on you? Some people keep an anger journal to better identify their patterns. For self-harm, too, it is important to notice what triggers you.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Express your anger calmly.</b> Be gentle, centered, caring. Get others to listen to your anger by expressing it in appropriate ways. Always try to express anger face to face and really "see" the other person. Also, get help from others before expressing it: Ask your therapist, friend, or sponsor how to express the anger. If you start to escalate (yelling, anger above a 5 on a 0-10 scale), leave until you can come back and try again calmly
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Strive to get your needs met through your own efforts.</b> Once you have heard your needs, you can take care of them. If you are tired or hungry, get sleep or something to eat. If you feel disappointed that your partner doesn't want to spend more time with you, consider couple therapy or find other people to do more activities with. Remember that ultimately you are responsible for your own happiness. There are always ways to improve your situation.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Explore how anger relates to your PTSD and substance abuse.</b> How did each of these contribute to your anger?
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> If you want to change others, use methods that work.</b> Anger and criticism never change people in the long run. People just feel afraid of you and avoid you. Methods that do work include negotiation, empathy, praise, and teaching.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Take good care of yourself.</b> People who hurt others are typically not getting their needs met in healthy ways. People who harm themselves typically put others' needs before theirs too much. If you hear the needs behind your anger you may notice, for example, "I need someone to listen to me," "I need to say 'no,' " "I need to take more time for myself."
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Change "shoulds" to "wants." </b>All anger has a "should" statement in it-for example, "My partner should do what I ask." A very helpful strategy is to change the "should" statement to a statement beginning with "I want": "I want my partner to do what I ask." Do you notice your feelings shift when vou do this? Usually it makes you aware of limitations that are important to accept. Much anger is a way to gain control in situations where you do not have it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Create "win-win" solutions.</b> Take into account both your needs and the other person's. Take turns making decisions. Take turns listening and speaking.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Notice why you did what you did.</b> Much anger (especially self-harm) comes from self-criticism. If you become angry with yourself because of something you did or didn't do, try to see why you made that choice. Being compassionate allows you to take responsibility for your actions and move forward.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Notice low-level anger.</b> People who act out anger often have trouble expressing it as it builds up. They bottle it up and then blow up, often triggered by some small event. Notice your anger in its low-level forms (e.g., annoy-ance, irritation), and try to get your needs met then so it won't build up.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Protect yourself from angry influences.</b> Observe how you are affected by violent movies, watching television news, or being around angry people. There is often a connection between larger cultural forces and your anger.
			But remember that anger is a habit that you can change.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Notice how anger gets misdirected.</b> Anger often gets directed at people who do not deserve it or who do not deserve it so intensely. For example, perhaps you get very angry over some "small" thing-such as a clerk at a store who gives you wrong information. You might say to yourself, "I'm furious, but it doesn't make sense to be so angry about this. I think I'm really angry, deep down, about feeling like no one ever helps me out. I need to start getting more support, rather than blowing up at a store clerk."
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Notice whose point of view is being neglected.</b> If you are angry at others, try to listen to others' point of view more. If you are angry at yourself, try to listen to your point of view (or the various sides of yourself) more. The goal is to hear both your own and others' point of view at the same time.
			Apologize to people you've hurt with your anger. This does not fully take it away, but it may help. If you can, try to explain the painful feelings that drive your anger.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b> Recognize that you may need to mourn things you cannot change.</b> Ultimately, after doing whatever you can to get your needs met, there may be some that can never be fulfilled. Perhaps you have a medical illness that will never go away. Perhaps you are too old to have a child or to have the career you want. Perhaps your partner cannot be the person you want. With situations that you cannot change, you will need to mourn and accept them. This is emotional work that you can and should do, but that may need a therapist's help.

		<h3>
			AN EXAMPLE OF THE THREE STEPS
		</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Situation:</b> Your boss gives a promotion to someone who deserves it less than you.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Motivate:</b> You say to yourself that blowing up at your boss will not help anything. You need to keep your job. Yelling at people has lost you jobs in the past.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Contain:</b> You decide to wait at least 24 hours before going in to see your boss. During those 24 hours, you try to stay calm and distract yourself with activities. You say to yourself, "No matter what, I am going to deal with this in a constructive way."
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> Listen:</b> You recognize that all your life it has felt as though you get less than others. It is extremely painful to be disappointed by your boss. But you recognize that your intense feelings are partly due to feeling neglected when you were growing up. You remind yourself that in the working world politics often wins out, and you're not the first to have this happen to you. You decide to talk to your therapist to role-play how to discuss the issue with your boss.
				After doing this, you go into your boss's office. You say to your boss, "I'd like to understand better why the promotion went to someone else rather than me. Please explain it to me." Your boss gives you a vague answer and seems uncomfortable. You realize that he's not going to tell you the truth. You calmly leave the office. You say to yourself,
				"I have two options: I can either stay in this job and recognize that there are some major limitations here. Or I can apply for a new job. But either way, I did not blow up at anyone, and that is a major victory."
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>
			ROLE PLAYS
		</h3>
		<p>
			<em>
				* Rehearse how you can work on your anger constructively. If you want, try one of the role plays below:
			</em>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				You have PTSD and vou're angry at feeling miserable so much of the time.
			</li>
			<li>
				You help out a "friend" who then won't help you in return		
			</li>
			<li>
				Your partner keeps refusing to pay child support.		
			</li>
			<li>
				Your insurance company cancels your policy by mistake, then gives you the "run-around."		
			</li>
			<li>
				Someone cuts you off in traffic.		
			</li>
			<li>
				Someone betrays a confidence.		
			</li>
			<li>
				Someone makes a nasty comment.		
			</li>
			<li>
				You think about how much of your life you've lost due to your substance abuse and PTSD.		
			</li>
			<li>
				You feel furious at yourself for using substances.
			</li>
			<li>
				You feel like killing yourself.		
			</li>
			<li>
				There is a long line at the post office, and you have very little time to wait.
			</li>
			<li>
				You find out your partner is cheating on you.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>
			Discovery versus Staying Stuck
		</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		Discovery is one of the most powerful tools in recovery.
		"Discovery" means finding out.
		. learning from experience . . . adapting . . . curiosity . . . openness . .. moving
		forward.
		growth.
		Discovery is what children do naturally-they try to explore, find out, and have fun in trying new things. Other people who discover are explorers, artists, scientists, detectives, and hopefully you!
		Staying stuck is the opposite of discovery.
		"Staying stuck" means assuming ... avoiding . .. rigid thinking . .. hiding . . . living in the past ... being closed to the world.
		One of the difficulties of PTSD and substance abuse is staying stuck. For example, if you've had PTSD for years without getting better, you may not feel like trying any more. Or, if you've been using heroin to feel relaxed, you may not search for other ways to relax.
		<h3>A STORY</h3>
		Situation: Amy has been Iying to her therapist, Dr. Burke, about her cocaine use because she feels ashamed.
		She believes he'll stop working with her if he finds out.
		Compare two different endings to the story:
		Amy tries discovery. She tells Dr. Burke the truth because she thinks, "It'll be better to find out than to keep living with this shame." Dr. Burke asks her to start getting weekly urine tests, because the treatment cannot work if Amy hides her substance use. Amy resents this, but also sees that Dr. Burke is trying to help and will keep working with her.
		Amy stays stuck. She keeps hiding the truth from Dr. Burke. Eventually she feels so bad that she stops attending treatment altogether because she can't take the self-hatred. She uses more and more cocaine.
		<h3>THE PROCESS OF DISCOVERY</h3>
		<p><b>1. Notice your belief. For example:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>"I believe that if I tell my friend I'm angry with him, he'll leave.</li>
			<li>"I believe calling a hotline will make me feel more depressed."</li>
			<li>"I believe I'll never get a job."</li>
			<li>"I believe AA will be boring."</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>2. Find an image (optional). If you want, think of an image that helps you discover:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>An explorer ... embarking on a search</li>
			<li>A detective ... trying to find out</li>
			<li>A child . . . interested and curious</li>
			<li>An artist . .. playing with possibilities</li>
			<li>A scientist . .. searching for the truth Or write your own image here:</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<b>
				3. Try discovery. Create a plan to actually find out if your belief is true. Some ways are listed in Handout 2.		
			</b>
		</p>

		<h2>
			How to Find Out If Your Belief Is True ...
		</h2>
		<hr class="fade">
		<p><b>* Ask People *</b></p>
		<p>
			"Ask People" means that you check out your belief by hearing what others think of it. The more people you ask, the better, so that you can see how much agreement there is about your belief.
			Example: Sarah believed, "If I let myself cry, I'd never stop." She decided to ask another patient (who was further along in recovery) and her therapist, and to read a book about PTSD. The result: All three sources conveyed the idea that while it is very common to feel this way, it is not true everyone stops crying eventually.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Try It and See *</b>
		</p>
		<p>

			"Try It and See" means "go for it"-try doing something and see what happens. You can also think of it as setting up an experiment because, like a scientist, you design a test and then observe what happens.
			Example: Doug was living with a roommate who grew marijuana in the house. He believed, "My roommate won't be willing to stop." He decided to use "Try It and See" by asking the roommate directly. The roommate re-fused. Doug decided that it would be unhealthy to keep living with someone so unsupportive of his recovery, so he decided to move out.
		</p>
		<p><b>* Predict *</b></p>
		<p>
			"Predict" means comparing what you think will happen versus what actually happens.
			Example: Judy believed, "No matter how hard I try, I'll never learn to use my computer." She felt stupid. To discover the truth, she decided to take a computer class at the local adult learning center. With instruction and practice, she was able to learn the basics, and this made her want to continue with it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>* Act as If *</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			"Act as If" means trying on a more positive belief to see how it feels. It is especially helpful in situations where you cannot actually find out the truth.
		</p>
		<p> 
			Example: Rick was driving down the highway and a car cut him off. He said, "That jerk! People are so rude." He felt furious. He decided to try acting as if he believed, "That man is driving his pregnant wife to the hospital to have a baby-no wonder he's in a rush!" He felt better and slowed down when he assumed this belief. Since he couldn't find out the truth of the situation-why the car cut him off-he might as well choose to believe the gentler explanation that made him less mad. At the end of the handouts, you can read about a real patient who tried this strategy by going through a weekend "acting as if I liked myself."
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>What does it feel like to try discovery?</b> It may feel okay, or it may feel scary, risky, or awkward. Don't worry if it doesn't feel good right now; it just matters that you try it. In the long run, you are likely to feel good about it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Remember safety.</b> As always, make sure that what you set out to do is safe. For example, don't try discovery with anyone who might physically hurt you, such as an abusive partner.
		</p>


		<h3>COPING WITH BAD NEWS</h3>
		<p>
			If you try discovery and things go well, you'll naturally feel much better. But sometimes you'll get negative feedback from your process of discovery. It may feel as though your worst nightmare has come true. For example:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You may find out that no matter how hard you try, you can't find a job.</li>
			<li>You may get an HIV test and find out you have HIV.</li>
			<li>You may find out that when you tell the truth to your friend, the friend rejects you.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Some people respond to negative feedback by hurting themselves, giving up on life, getting mad at the world, or trying to avoid getting feedback again. Here are some suggestions for healthier ways to cope with negative feedback:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>	Give yourself credit</b> for having had the courage to try discovery. No matter what happens, you were brave, open, and on the right path just by trying.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Figure out, "What's the worst that can happen?"</b> For example, you may lose a friend but gain self-respect. You may have HIV but can get medical care to prevent it from getting worse.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Never take it out on yourself</b> by self-destructiveness, such as drowning your sorrows in substances, self-harm, or self-hatred.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Remember that negative feedback is just information,</b> nothing more. If you can listen to it, you can learn much even if it's painful. The most painful truth is better in the long run than the most positive lie. (And if you don't believe this-try using discovery to find out!)
			</li>
		</ol>

			+ Option 2: Try, for one day, to "act as if you like yourself." Later, write out how it went. Below is an example of one person's attempt to do this.
		</p>

		<h3>
			EXAMPLE OF ONE PERSON'S "ACT AS IF" DISCOVERY
		</h3>
		<p>
			One person decided to try the "Act as If" method of discovery by "acting as if I like myself" for a day. These were the results.
		</p>
		<p>
			"On Friday, I kept having to remember to like myself. It is a funny feeling but it puts a smile on my face. I don't act so self-destructive when I try to like myself. I walked. I went to the College Club play, and out afterwards. I had no desire to drink.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Saturday I woke up in positive spirits. Went to an A meeting. One of the first in ages. I had to keep thinking I like myself; it's hard when I'm used to thinking negative. Walked the dogs with Chris from group and enjoyed the day. Even talked to some of the people in AA.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Saturday night I'm not sure what happened. I was alone, isolating, and I forgot to like myself. I really have to think about it to remember to like myself. But I became very depressed, lonely, and for comfort turned to my old friends alcohol and food. Mavbe it is that the 'old wav with the 'old escapes' is easier because that's what I know. It is scary for me to be out in the real world-with people, at AA, etc. I have never felt more alone than I did Saturday night. I felt no one would ever love me, that I will never have a positive relationship with anyone, or have friends. All I felt was pain.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Sunday morning I remembered that I was supposed to be liking myself. It was kind of a 'yeah, right' feel-ing. But I made an attempt. But the day was so-so. For the first time in ages I prayed on Sunday morning. I know that sounds hokey, like you hear in A all the time--but I did. I asked not to drink, to get better, and with help to let go of the fears which hold me back in life, from getting better, from getting help, etc. I took the dogs to the woods and walked them. Sunday afternoon I isolated and slept. Sunday night, I did not drink but felt sad.
			I obviously was forgetting to like myself.

			"Monday I woke up more determined than ever to get the help I need and not give up. To treat myself as if I liked myself-like I would another person. That thinking helped. I took more care with my appearance. And became more assertive with my therapist about getting more help. I'd rather get help before there is a crisis. I took steps to take care of myself and meet some of my needs. Followed steps after therapy to try and get more help.
			Also talked to my parents honestly about the need for more help and not be so worried instead about pleasing them, others, etc. Feel good about these steps but a little scared.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What I learned from this assignment is that by trying to like myself, I act in a more positive fashion. It is hard to do this all the time and for me feels like being on shaky ground. However, I want to keep trying to think and feel this way because if I keep working on it I will take better care of myself and my needs--hopefully creating a more positive world for myself where I handle and cope with life's ups and downs in an honest, straightforward fashion. I want to like myself so that the relationships I develop are positive ones, not destructive relationships that only serve to feed into my past old escapes. I hope that with practice, liking myself will be more comfortable than the past comfort of disliking myself."

</ol>
<p><b>What Is "the Split Self"?</b></p> 
<p>
"The split self" refers to different sides of the self that can occur in both PTSD and substance abuse. Becoming aware of these different sides can help you recover.
</p>
<p>
<b>Substance abuse examples.</b> One part of you wants to use substances while another part doesn't. This is sometimes called "Jekyll and Hyde."
</p>
<p>
<b>PTSD examples.</b> Parts of you might feel like "a little child" who needs protection; a "fighter" who bullies; a
"teenager" who wants to have fun without worrying about tomorrow; and a "healthy one" who wants to work hard on recovery.
</p>
<p>
<b>Splitting Happens for a Very Good Reason</b>
</p>
<p>
Splitting is a psychological defense in which your internal world has different states of consciousness that emerge at different times. Just as a country needs an army for defense, so too the mind needs defenses when it is being attacked by devastating life experiences. Remember, these are normal and typical in PTSD and substance abuse; they were necessary for your survival. They do not mean that you are crazy. Also, many "normal" people have splits to some degree; the issue is how much they have them, and how dangerous they are.
</p>
<p>
If you have splits, it means that you had a psychological need earlier in your life to reject some part of yourself.
For example, if you drove drunk and caused a terrible car accident, you may have felt extremely guilty but could not face those feelings at the time. The guilt may keep "popping up" in various ways in your life (as in bad dreams or flashbacks). Splits can also arise in childhood if your family rejected important parts of you. If it was not safe for you to express anger, for example, the anger may have became split off. But the split-off side doesn't go away-it stays hidden and emerges at times that may surprise you. You may notice that you feel ashamed about whatever side of yourself has been split off.
</p>
<p>
With PTSD and substance abuse, the sides that get rejected are typically those that want to use substances (you may feel "bad" for having cravings), that get angry (you feel you should always be "nice"), or that feel vulnerable (you feel you should always be "strong").
</p>
<p>
None of this is your fault-it all happens unconsciously, without awareness. (If you were aware of it, it wouldn't be split!)
</p>

<p><b>Splitting Leads to Unsafe Behavior</b></p>
<p>
You are not in control of your rejected sides, because they are hidden. When you don't have control over them, they can control you by emerging at times when you don't expect them, or by "blotting out" healthier sides. This can be unsafe.

<h3>THE GOAL OF INTEGRATION</h3>
<p>
	<b>
Integration Is the Way to Overcome the Split Self
</b>
</p>
<p>
	<p>
The way out of splitting is to integrate and accept the sides of yourself that have been rejected. What would it be like? If you felt angry, you would respect that the anger is there for a good reason. Rather than stifling it, you would seek to "hear" it and to express it in a safe way. The goal is to have access to all parts of yourself whenever you choose to. However, know that this may be difficult after a lifetime of rejecting those sides, or if they remind you of someone you hated (e.g., an abuser).
</p>
<p>
	<b>
How Can You Work with the Different Sides?
</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Acknowledge, respect, and "own" these different sides, even if you don't like them.</b> It may feel as though you just want to get rid of some part of you. This doesn't work, as it is there for a good reason. A deeply caring attitude toward every part of you is what helps your recovery.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Try to remind yourself of the other sides if one side takes over.</b> If a side emerges that wants to drink, remind yourself that another side of you doesn't want to. If a side of you doesn't want to come to treatment, remind yourself of the side that does.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Do not punish yourself if you do something wrong.</b> Blame, guilt, shame, and "beating yourself up" increase the likelihood of maintaining splits. Why? Because they represent a lack of acceptance. If you do something you don't like, try to understand it calmly and respectfully.		
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Create healthy dialogue among the different sides.</b> Some people find success in "calling a conference" among the different sides of the self, so that all sides can be heard. Or one side can try to soothe another side. Allowing the sides to "talk" to one another may sound bizarre, but in fact can be very healing. Try rehearsing, out loud or on paper, what a healthy dialogue among sides of yourself might sound like.

</ul>

<h2>
Ideas for a Commitment
</h2>
<hr class="fade">
<p>
Commit to one action that will move your life forward!
It can be anything you feel will help you, or you can try one of the ideas below.
Keeping your commitment is a way of respecting, honoring, and caring for yourself.
</p>
<p>
+ Option 1: Write a letter of acceptance to a part of yourself you've rejected. Promise to respect and listen to it.
</p>
<p>
+ Option 2: Think of the last time you used a substance (or had other dangerous behavior): What part of you led to the dangerous behavior? What part of you was not present?
</p>
<p>
+ Option 3: Write a brief description of your different sides, including both those you like and those you don't.
</p>
<p>
+ Option 4: Try having a healthy dialogue between parts of yourself (in your mind or on paper). Can one side soothe another side, for example
</p>
<p>
+ Option 5: Fil out the Safe Coping Sheet. (See below for an example applied to this topic.)

        <h2>
          Key Points about Red and Green Flags
        </h2>
        <hr class="fade">
        <p>
          <b>* Red flags are messages of distress.</b> Just as a fever is a sign that you must rest your body, the red flags are signs that you are in emotional distress. With PTSD and substance abuse, the tendency is to push them out of mind, unconscious, not seeing the signs as they occur. But it is essential to notice the red flags and to validate that they are there for a reason; they are not signs of weakness or failure, but messages to attend to yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Remember "budding."</b> Some people are helped by the acronym "BUD"-"Building Up to Drinking." You could also use "Building Up to Danger." The list of red flags in Handouts 1 and 2 can be a sign that you are gearing up to act destructively. There is a window of opportunity during which you can stop yourself from sliding downhill if you can see the warning signs and actively try to cope with them. Thus dangerous times in both PTSD and substance abuse are not all-or-none events, but rather gradual buildups that allow time to save yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>• Help from others is essential as danger escalates.</b> As red flags increase, the need to reach out for help from safe people increases too. One of the most difficult aspects of PTSD and substance abuse is isolation. As symptoms increase,
          the tendency is to hide away. That's why it is necessary to plan in advance whom you will call and to
          prepare that person for how to help you through a dangerous time. Rehearse what you will say to each other.
          * Listen to the "whispers" before they become "screams." A safety plan identifies your warning signs and ways to respond to them. The safety plan in Handout 2 has three levels so that you can attend to mild danger signs (level 1) before they become an emergency (level 3). The earlier in the process you take action, the better.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>• As danger increases, so does acting out rather than talking.</b> Notice that many of the danger signs are behaviors. As distress increases, it is essential to keep talking about your feelings; otherwise you'll likely find yourself
          "acting them out" in your behavior. Think of a small child who feels hurt and starts punching a wall. When the child cannot express the feelings directly, they get acted out.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>* Most substance abuse relapses occur within 90 days of abstinence.</b> Research shows the first 90 days to be a vulnerable time, across various substances of abuse (heroin, smoking, alcohol). Thus knowing your danger signs is especially important in early recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>• Notice spiraling.</b> In recovery, there is a process of "spiraling" or "snowballing" that can occur in both positive and negative directions. A downward spiral occurs when symptoms start to pick up speed and get worse and worse, often rapidly. An upward spiral occurs when your recovery efforts are so persistent that good things begin to happen. For example, you get a job, and are therefore able to get an apartment in a safer area, where you can make friends with healthier people, and so on ...
